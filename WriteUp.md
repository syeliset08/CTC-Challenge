## 1. What did you build for Part B, and why that?

> What made you pick it over everything else you could have built? This is the
> question we care most about - the _why_ matters more than the _what_.

## 2. What did you decide, and what did you rule out?

> Route shapes, data model, where the logic lives, what you deliberately didn't
> do. Name a tradeoff you're not sure you got right.

## 3. Where did you cut corners?

> What would you fix first with another day?

## Part B: routes

> Every endpoint you added, with its request and response shapes, so we can
> exercise it without reverse-engineering your code. Add or remove rows as
> needed; delete this section if your Part B added no routes.

| Method and path | What it does | Success | Errors       |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------- | ------------ |
| `GET /api/...`  |              | `200` + | `404` if ... |
| `POST /api/...` |              | `201` + | `400` on ... |

**`POST /api/...`**

```jsonc
// request
{ }

// 201 response
{ }
```

## Schema changes

## How I verified this

> How you checked your work - the happy paths _and_ the failures. `curl`
> commands, a Postman collection, a scratch script, screenshots: whatever you
> actually used. Paste the commands.

> This is much faster for us to review than working it out ourselves, and it's
> how you show you checked the edge cases.

**Part A** - the contract table in CHALLENGE.md, every row including the error
cases:

```bash
# e.g.
curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/restaurants          # 200 + array
curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/restaurants/99999    # 404
curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/restaurants/abc      # 404
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/restaurants \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Out Of Range","rating":6}'              # 400
```

**Part B** - the equivalent cases for what you built:

```bash

```

## Known issues / what I'd do next
